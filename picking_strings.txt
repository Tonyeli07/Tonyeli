Picking Two Strings

1. 'Isidentifier'
2. 'maketrans'

a = 'isidentifier'
b = 'maketrans'

Figuring out what both strings mean

1. isidentifier()
This in-built function of Python is used to check whether a string is a valid identifier or not. 
The method returns True if the string is a valid identifier else returns False.
The method does not take any parameters
Example:


2. maketrans()
The maketrans() method returns a translation table that maps each character in the intabstring into the character at the same position in the outtab string. 
Then this table is passed to the translate() function.
Both intab and outtab must have the same length.

Intab:
This is the string having actual characters.

Outtab:
This is the string having corresponding mapping character.

Example:
intab = "aeiou"
outtab = "12345"
trantab = str.maketrans(intab, outtab)

str = "this is string example....wow!!!"
print (str.translate(trantab))
Produce: th3s 3s str3ng 2x1mpl2....w4w!!!
