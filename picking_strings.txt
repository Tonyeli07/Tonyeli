Picking Two Strings

1. 'Isidentifier'
2. 'maketrans'

a = 'isidentifier'
b = 'maketrans'

Figuring out what both strings mean

1. isidentifier()
isidentifier() method of builtins.str instance
    Return True if the string is a valid Python identifier, False otherwise.
    
    Call keyword.iskeyword(s) to test whether string s is a reserved identifier,
    such as "def" or "class".


2. maketrans()
The maketrans() method returns a translation table that maps each character in the intabstring into the character at the same position in the outtab string. 
Then this table is passed to the translate() function.
Both intab and outtab must have the same length.

Intab:
This is the string having actual characters.

Outtab:
This is the string having corresponding mapping character.

Example:
intab = "aeiou"
outtab = "12345"
trantab = str.maketrans(intab, outtab)

str = "this is string example....wow!!!"
print (str.translate(trantab))
Produce: th3s 3s str3ng 2x1mpl2....w4w!!!
