Scanning the Page

Print = alpha characters
Alpha characters are letters from A-Z
Numeric factors = numbers that contain 0 and 9
Non-characters = print numeric characters 
#Tally each alpha character printed to get total count on page
#Tally each non-character printed to get total count on page

Identifying and Printing alpha characters 

Scan page and identify alpha characters and non-characters
If page contains alpha letters:
    print and move on to next line
    tally each alpha character in each line
else: print numbers as non-characters 
      tally all non-characters


Scan the entire page from the first line on top through to the last line on the bottom
On each page is an image full of characters
As you scan page, each letter between A-Z should be printed and tallied as scanning goes
In the same process, scan and tally any numeric factor and print as non-character
Tally all non-characters recorded
