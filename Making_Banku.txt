Making The Infamous Ghana Banku And Pepper with fried tilapia

Part 1: Ingredients acquisition from store

Go to a tropical or an african market and ask the seller for these items:
3 red tomatoes
One full onion
An entire garlic stack
Two fresh tilapia
One bottle of vegetable oil
One bottle of sea salt or any other salt

Part 2: Preparing Ingredients

Ingredients Needed for Banku
Cassava flour
Cold water
Cooking silverware to contain hot water
stove
A wooden laddle/spoon
Salt (optional but it's good for tasting purposes)

You need white cassava flour from an African store that has one
Then fetch about 4 to 5 cups of cold tap water in a silverware 
Scoop about 3 handful of the cassava flour and put into silverware
Stir the cassava flour with your bare hands till it dissolves into a neutral form
Then turn on stove to at least medium (if you're not in a rush)
Put the mix on the stove and let it sit until it starts to form more into a solid
Then you start to stir even more as the mix solidifies
At this point, you can increase the temperature to at least in between medium to keep it from not burning out the mix
As the mix gets harder, you can actually start to put some strength while you stir
The thicker the mix, the harder you have to stir
You stir the mix for about 15 - 20 minutes
Your fresh hot Banku is ready after the initial white color of the cassava flour turns almost dirty white
When done, put into nice and clean bowl for consumption
Your Banku is ready for your stomach
